Azure Functions = Event + Code
Azure Function App = Deployment Unit
Event = Scheduled Time OR Process a message or new items in blob storage OR HTTP Request or WebHook
App Service + Web Jobs
Azure Functions -
    - Simplified Programming model
            - Just the code to response to events
            - Eliminate bolierplate
            - Focus on business requirement
    - Consumption based pricing model
        - Pay as you go
        - Only pay for what you use
        - Automatic scale
    - Pricing Plans 
        - Run in a App-Service Plan
        - Or use the consumption Plan

    - Charged in 2 metrics (Billing model)
        - Number of executions
        - CPU Time (s) * RAM (GB) GbS

    - Free monthly grant 
        - 1,000,000 executions
        - 400,000 Gb-S

    Reduce your costs with 
        - Faster invocation times
        - Fewer invocations
        - Reduced memory requirements
    Consumption Plan 
        - Limited to 5 mins per execution
        - Optional maily daily quota
    Regular App Service Plan 
        - Pay for dedicated servers
        - Predictable monthly cost
        - Serveral pricing tiers of App Service
        - No Function duration constraints
    Azure Functions premium plan
        - Vnet Connectivity
        - Improved Performance

    Azure Function Runtime is available as a docker container
        - Host anywhere

Benefits of Azure Functions
    Rapid and simple development 
        - Code within Azure portal
        - Eliminate bolier plate
    All the power of Azure Apps - CI, KUDU, Easy Auth, Certifcates, Custom Domains, Settings etc
    Cost-effective pricing 
        - Pay for what you use
    No servers to maintain and automatic scaling 

Serverless Architecture
    - Delegate the management of servers and Automatic Scaling ( FAAS - Function as a Service)
    - even wiring up of events is transparent for you

Azure Function lets you group together related functions together into Function Apps to share configuration settings and local resources



What are the Azue Function Use Case -
    - Experiments and prototyping
    - Automatic development process ( Use a web hook with a slack channed with CI)
    - Decomposing or extending monolithic application

    - Independent scaling
    - Adpater for integrating systems   
    - Go Serverless
